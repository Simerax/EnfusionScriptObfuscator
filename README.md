EnfusionScript Obfuscator

This Project is meant for Mod Creators of the Game [DayZ](https://dayz.com/).
At the moment mods are stolen and "repacked" without giving proper credit to the original creators.
This Obfusctar should make it harder to steal and copy code from mods without the original creator knowing about it.

Of course this does not prevent copying complete mods but it will make stealing parts of the code a lot harder.
